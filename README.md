# Projectify

**Projectify** is a Final Year Project Management System developed during our Diploma in Information Technology (Year 2, Semester 5) at Asia Pacific University. It is inspired by the functionality of Moodle but enhanced to better facilitate complex student project management, task tracking, and collaborative communication.

## 🧠 Abstract

The goal of Projectify is to improve how students and educators manage academic projects. While Moodle is a popular Learning Management System, it lacks robust tools for hands-on, collaborative project handling. Projectify bridges that gap by offering an integrated web platform where students can upload tasks, engage in discussions, track their project milestones, and collaborate seamlessly.

It also includes features for lecturers and administrators to monitor progress, manage users and institutions, and provide meaningful feedback. With a focus on usability, Projectify aims to streamline the educational project experience for all users.
